## Portfolio Darryl de Jong
### This is a simple website I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show my skills, projects, and contact info. You can learn more about what I do and check out some of the work I've done as an IT student.

### Visit my website here: [darryldejong.github.io](https://darryldejong.github.io/)
The website has a responsive design and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### For the website, I used:
- FontAwesome and Devicons for the icons
- Particles.js for a dynamic background
- Google Fonts for the text style
- DeviantArt for images and sprites
